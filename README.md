# Lyft Technical Sample README

This project is a small sample requested for the 2022 Lyft Apprenticeship application
This project was coded using javascript and React.js.\

To sample the project, you can run:

### 'yarn start'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

For the API call to work you will need a CORS unblocker, I use "CORS Unblock", available on the chome webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino/
